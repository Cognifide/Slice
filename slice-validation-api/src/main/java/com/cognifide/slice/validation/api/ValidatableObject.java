 * Model object is the domain-specific representation of the data upon which the application operates. Domain
 * logic adds meaning to raw data (for example, calculating whether today is the user's birthday, or the
 * totals, taxes, and shipping charges for shopping cart items).
 * 
 * The object can be in three states:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>valid</b> - model can be displayed in the view,</li>
 * <li><b>invalid</b> - populated incorrectly; error message should be displayed in the view,</li>
 * <li><b>empty</b> - not populated at all; specific error message should be displayed in the view - most
 * likely user didn't do anything wrong yet, just created empty component and has to pick it up.</li>
 * </ul>
