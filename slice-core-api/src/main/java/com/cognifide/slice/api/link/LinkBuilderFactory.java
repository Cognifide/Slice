	 * in the request URI after the content path is a dot, the string after the dot up to but not including
	 * the last dot before the next slash character or the end of the request URI. If the content path spans
	 * the complete request URI or if a slash follows the content path in the request, then no selectors
	 * exist. If only one dot follows the content path before the end of the request URI or the next slash, no
	 * selectors exist. The selectors are available as a list of strings {@link LinkBuilder#getSelectors()}.

	 * slash after the content path in the request uri. If the content path spans the complete request URI or
	 * a slash follows the content path in the request URI, the extension is empty. The extension is available
	 * as a strings {@link com.cognifide.slice.api.link.LinkBuilder#getExtension()}.
