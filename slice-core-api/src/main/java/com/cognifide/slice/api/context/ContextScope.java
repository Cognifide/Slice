/**
 * @author Rafa≈Ç Malinowski
 * 
 * This Guice {@link Scope} stores all objects in Context object which is provided by specified
 * {@link ContextProvider}. ContextProvider object is stored on per-thread basis, so each thread can have its
 * own Context (it is also possible to create ContextProvider that shares data between threads).
 * 
 * ContextProvider object can be changed at any time and Context object returning by this provider can change
 * too. Thanks to that objects that are scoped in context ({@link ContextScoped} can be stored per-thread,
 * per-request or even per-second. It only requires an appropriate implementation of ContextProvider and
 * Context interfaces.
