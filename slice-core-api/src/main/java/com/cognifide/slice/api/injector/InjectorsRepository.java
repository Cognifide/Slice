 * 
 * Helper class to get Injector instances. Slice supports multiple injectors installed on one instance, with
 * each injector being tagged with name of the application that created it. By standard, the application name
 * is the name of its folder under /apps.
 * 
 * Injector can be retrieved in three different ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>by specifying injector / application name ({@link #getInjector(String injectorName)}),</li>
 * <li>for specific resource, by passing the resource ({@link #getInjectorForResource(Resource resource)}), or
 * </li>
 * <li>for specific resource, by passing it's path ({@link #getInjectorForResource(String resourcePath)}).</li>
 * </ul>
